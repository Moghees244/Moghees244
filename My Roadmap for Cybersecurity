First of all I am a student myself, so what I will tell is based on my personal research and my discussions with some people in industry.
First of all cybersecurity is not all about ethical hacking there are other fields as well like digital forensics, SOC analyst etc. Dont forget to explore them.

So my suggested roadmap is:

1. Focus on your programming it is important in my opinion some people say its not but i dont think so

2. Since you know linux, go to this link and study this module and see if their is anything you dont know. Complete the module.

3. study COAL as it will help in exploit dev or malware analysis etc in future. and then play crackmes

4. Networking

go to this link and complete this module. This will give you a good idea of networking. After that I would say study course of CCNA from youtube or read book if you can. 

5. Once done with that learn to use wireshark properly.
